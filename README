A drawing app as a pet project.
To compile this, you'll need Qt 5 and qmake. On Windows it will create a static build and thus need a static version of Qt. By default Qt libraries are dynamic (if you get the binary version). If you don't want to compile a static version of Qt (hint: you probably shouldn't try doing so, since Qt 5 is still very new and its static version is somewhat broken), open the .pro file in Qt creator and read the comments on how to build with dynamic linking instead (basically, comment out the last lines).

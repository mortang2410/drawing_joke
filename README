A drawing app as a pet project.
To compile this, you'll need Qt 5 and qmake. By default on Windows it will create a static build and thus need a statically built version of Qt. By default Qt libraries are dynamic (if you get the binary version). If you don't want to compile a static version of Qt (hint: you probably shouldn't try doing so, since it's still somewhat broken), open the .pro file in Qt creator and read the comments on how to build with dynamic linking instead (basically, comment out the last lines).
